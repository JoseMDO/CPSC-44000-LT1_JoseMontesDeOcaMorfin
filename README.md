Assignment 1 - Looking for Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses
In this program. We ask the user for a 'n'th power and a maximum number. 
Then we go through every combiantion of x and y from 1 - maximum number and raise them to the 'n'th power. 
We then add those two and try and find the closest possible number 'z' to make this equation true
(x^n) + (y^n) = (z^n)
